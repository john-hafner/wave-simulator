# three-js-tutorial

This is the base tutorial I've used, and want to take it & run creating a
3d wave simulator.

To start with I want to take a plane, or sheet of graph paper and make a time
series wave ripple effect and after that begin showing probability waves
simulating the Schrodinger Wave Equation.
